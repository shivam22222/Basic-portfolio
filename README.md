### Basic-Portfolio
This is a very basic portfolio code using HTML and CSS only. If you want same for yourself then just fork this and change the *data* according to your preference. The current philosophy of UI design is “less is more,” the expected rise in popularity of minimalism has reached an all-time high and I have tried one more time to touch this concept as usual.

**Note** *If you're not using custom domain then delete the CNAME file after forking this repo!*
